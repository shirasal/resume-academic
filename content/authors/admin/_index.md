Ecologist, data enthusiast, graphics appreciator.  

I'm a masters student in the Belmaker Lab, where I learn how biotic and abiotic factors affect the fish community in the Mediterranean Sea, through networks models. In my current research I am testing the effect of occurrence of fish species on the occurrence of other species, along temperature gradients and in and out of marine protected areas (MPAs). Nature fascinates me and marine nature is my passion. I like to combine that with another passion of mine - data :heart_eyes: . Data allows us to explore this world and have meaningful insights on the environment and its inhabitants.
Along with working on my thesis, I am doing data analysis work for HaMaarag organisation, which is monitoring the state of nature in Israel.
